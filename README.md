# AI-Trading---KNN-using-OHLC

This is the first paper about Trading using Machine Learning. The purpose is to create a starting point with simple concepts.

In this case we use a k-nearest neighbours algorithm to predict whether the next day of the SP500 will be up or down using only the differential between 1. the open and the close and 2. the high and the low.

The Jupyter Notebook version is also available in this repo.

I recommend you to register a profile on Quandl but be able to access the API freely.

Enjoy!
